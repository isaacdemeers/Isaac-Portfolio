## **Project Context**

PlanIt was developed as part of a **tutored project** during the third year of the **Bachelor of Multimedia and Internet Professions (BUT MMI)**. The project was carried out in a group of four students over a period of **four months**. The use of specific technologies, such as Symfony, API Platform, and React, was imposed to align with the program's objectives of mastering modern web development tools and methodologies. This collaborative effort allowed the team to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, simulating real-world development workflows.
